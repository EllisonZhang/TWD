ORM: object relational mapper. Data stored within a database table can be encapsulated within a model (ORM).

1. create class in models.py:  class represent for the tables in database
             By default, all models have an auto-increment integer field called id 
             which is automatically assigned and acts a primary key.
             
2. Initialised database (after editing the models.py):
    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py createsuperuser       //Whenever you make changes to your appâ€™s models, you need to register the changes 
    python manage.by makemigrations "filename"
    
  the database data will be then inside the migrations file ---0001_initial.py  
     python manage.py migrate // do this again to commit it in database
     
3.  python manage.py shell //interact with the models
    quit()
    
4. log in /admin/ 
we can register those tables by adding them in the   rango--admin.py:

from django.contrib import admin
from rango.models import Category, Page

admin.site.register(Category)
admin.site.register(Page)
